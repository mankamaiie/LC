# Reflection on Live Coding from ch.1

## Things that surprised or inspired me:

First is that greek word "programma" is actually means "write publicly". As David Ogborn said: "To define something is to take it to stake a claim to it's future, to make a claim about what it should become". So we, people, defined the word "programma" as "write publicly" and then coding is a secreet weapon. Not good! 

Second thing which inspired me a lot as a person who went throgh jazz improvisation, free improvisation and currently doing a research of where the music comes from when it's truly a free improvisation was the statement that live coding musician is an improvising composer, able to transform the whole structure of the piece with a few keystrokes. Wow! So much things to think about. 

## Things that didn't surprised me much


First is that live coders are the fighters for transparency - we talked about this in class, though in class it was a mind opening information for me. 

And the second one is that in the end of 20th century, computers came to many art practicies using specific programming languages such as Max/MSP, Supercollider, Csound and Pure Data.
