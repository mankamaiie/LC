# Research Presentation Proposal 

# Andrew Sorensen

I decided to do my research presentation about Andrew Sorensen. I’m a big fan of classical minimalism and abstractionism, so this performance really resonated with me.  I don’t really like the piano sound, though, and I'm not fond of all the sounds he uses. However, it was 15 years ago, so I think if he were to write this now, it would sound much better. But his approach is excellent!
