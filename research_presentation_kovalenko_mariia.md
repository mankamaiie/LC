Slide 1  Who is Andrew Sorensen?
Andrew Sorensen is a live coding musician, computer scientist, and educator. He is best known for creating his own programming languages, Impromptu and Extempore, which he uses in performance.

Slide 3 The Language as Instrument

For Sorensen, the language is not just a way to control sound - it defines the whole style of performance. This is why he builds his own systems rather than using existing. By creating Impromptu and Extempore, he can decide exactly how time is handled, how events are scheduled, and how sound is generated. 

Slide 4  Impromptu

Impromptu was Sorensen’s first live coding system. It was based on Scheme, a version of the Lisp programming language. Impromptu allowed him to code music and visuals at the same time, all in real time. One of its most important features was something called "temporal recursion". Instead of writing a normal loop, Sorensen would write a function that calls itself again after a certain amount of time. This created repeating but flexible structures that could be changed on the fly. Impromptu was the environment he used for his famous performance “A Study in Keith”, which showed how code could be used for improvisation in the style of jazz and modern classical music.

Slide 5 Extempore

After working with Impromptu, Sorensen developed a more advanced environment called Extempore, which he still uses today. Extempore combines the speed of a low-level language like C with the flexibility of a high-level language like Lisp. This means it can schedule musical events very precisely, without crashes or interruptions. Sorensen designed it specifically for improvisation, so it functions more like a responsive instrument than a piece of software. Extempore is now one of the most important live coding systems used internationally.

Slide 7  Different from Other Live Coders

His influences come from classical modernism and jazz improvisation, rather than electronic dance culture. This is why his performances often feel more like a contemporary concert. His approach shows that live coding is not limited to one genre but can be used in many different musical traditions.

Slide 8  A Study in Keith

One of Sorensen’s best known works is A Study in Keith, performed in 2007 using Impromptu. The title refers to jazz pianist Keith Jarrett. Like Jarrett, Sorensen starts with nothing and builds a complete piece in real time. At the beginning of the performance, there is complete silence for about two minutes while Sorensen writes the first functions. The audience sees the code on the screen, but no sound is heard yet. Then, as the functions are executed, small patterns begin to appear - a rhythm, a few notes, a repeated structure.
The structure grows as he edits and expands the code, layering more and more processes. Because he is using temporal recursion, each function generates events that can evolve in complex ways, rather than simply looping. The music gradually develops into something that sounds like a full improvisation, with multiple interacting voices.
